# BrainLove

**BrainLove** is a new version of [Brainfuck](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Brainfuck) , **BrainLove** is degined to let **BrainFuck **interagt with the "outsider world", this is actions like:

* IO
* Networking
* Get time
* Read Keyboard
* And more

## Why

I fell in love with **BrainFuck**, I felt the main thing holding me back was the <u>interface</u>. Mainly standard **Brainfuck** only really has a text interface, text in (`,`) and text out (`.`). But what if you wnated to do more? Call apis for example, you cant. That is what **BrainLove** is here to change
